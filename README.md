# Web3 and Standard Bounties SDK

Our SDK around managin web3 client states, web3 interactions, and interacting directly with our [standard bounties contract](https://github.com/Bounties-Network/StandardBounties/) and our [off-chain API endpoints](https://github.com/Bounties-Network/bountiesapi)

Reference [documentation here](https://dash.readme.io/go/bounties-public-modules)

This library is currently in alpha, and we are finalizing the pieces (build, structure, etc.) in order to make it a public, open source, configurable library.

This work will be done very soon, and we're excited to welcome the community to contribute. :)
